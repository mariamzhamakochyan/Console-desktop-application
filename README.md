# Doubly-Linked-List
Doubly Linked List contains a link element called head and tail. Each link carries a data field(s) and two link fields called next and prev. Each link is linked with its next link using its next link. Each link is linked with its previous link using its previous link.
We create a Doubly Linked list by using the Node class.

We add the following functionalities to the doublyLinkedList class. 

● append() : append element to list
● front() : access the first element
● back() : access the last element
● begin() : returns an iterator to the beginning
● end() : returns an iterator to the end
● empty() : checks whether the container is empty
● size() : returns the number of elements
● clear() : clears the contents
● insert() : inserts elements
● emplace() : constructs element in-place
● push_back() : adds an element to the end
● push_front() : inserts an element to the beginning
● resize() : changes the number of elements stored
● splice() : moves elements from another list
● merge() : merges two sorted lists
● remove_if() : removes elements satisfying specific criteria
● unique() : removes duplicate elements

We add the following operators to the doublyLinkedList class. 

● Operator stream out (cout) <<
● Operator is equal to ==
● Operator not equal to !=
● Operator +, +=
● Operator <= , < , > and >=
